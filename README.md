# Features

- Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for players and admins.
- Auto cycle between Dark & Light during day / night time.
- Spawn editor that allows server owners to create and modify locations with ease.
- Compatible with qb-housing & ps-housing.

# Usage

To use CL-SpawnSelector, simply drag & drop the resource after making sure the resource is called CL-SpawnSelector and not CL-SpawnSelector-main, then run the SQL table `cl_spawnselector`. After that set your server logo and permissions for the editor in 'config.lua'. 

When creating a new location using the editor make sure to add the necessary data to the `config.lua > Config.Locations`.
